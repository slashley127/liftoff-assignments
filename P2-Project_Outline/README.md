## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We will be creating a symptom tracker app. This will be useful for so many people who need a reliable way to track symptoms related to mental health, chronic illness, sleep habits, diet, medication changes, and even short term sickness such as flu or COVID-19. There are endless instances for why someone might need to track symptoms, and this user-friendly app is a dependable way to do so. 
With this app, you will be able to create a free and secure account where you can log and track symptoms. It’s easy to create a new symptom to track as well as add notes and tags that will make individual entries simple to find. Not only will you be able to log new updates to each symptom as needed, but you will also be able to visualize the data with graphs. A search function can be used to quickly and easily view entries from a specific date, making doctor visits a breeze. 
We understand how important your health is and this app makes it simple to track your symptoms so you don’t have to stress about adding the information into a bulky spreadsheet or notes app. You will get a more full and clear picture of your health as well as peace of mind. 

### Features
Secure User Login 
-Users will be able to create an account with secure login
-Users will have access to a personal profile that they can easily manage
Symptom Logging 
-A database will store data input by user 
-Users will be able to add custom symptoms to profile as well as individual instances of each symptom as needed 
-Each instance will be measured by severity - scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is symptom is low severity, 10 is symptom is high severity
-Instances can include personal notes
Data Visualization
-We will utilize a chart/analytics API to implement user-facing data visualization for symptoms
-Graphs will be simply tracking severity for each instance (date) (i.e. a line graph)
Dashboard Page
User dashboard page that shows symptoms tracked (maybe each symptom in its only box or area that can be clicked to open with more details?)

### Technologies
Java
Springboot
MySQL
JavaScript
React
Chart.js or other data visualization framework

### What I'll Have to Learn
-We would like to work with JavaScript and React for the front-end which is something we will all have to learn
-I have never worked with any sort of chart/analytics API and am excited to try and implement that
